<h2>ME IN 10 Seconds</h2>
<p>
I've been a quizzer, engineer, and an avid reader.
</p>
<p>
I'm a slow learner, traveller, xenophile and I love to focus on my breath.
</p>
<p>
Delhi Native, I now live in Gurugram,India

<h2> ME IN 10 Minutes? </h2>
<p>
See my <a href="/about.html">"about" page.</a>
</p>
<p>
The inspiration behind this website is <a href="https://www.sive.rs" target="_blank" derek siver's website</a>
</p><p>
I found a pressing need to make my own site and post my own content
</p><p>
I plan to use this as my personal workspace. No fancy substacks
</p><p>
no over the top designs, just me and my simple html and css
</p><p>
stay tuned guys. I know I'm late to the party but I'll catch up soon.
