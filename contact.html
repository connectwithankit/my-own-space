<h2>CONTACT</h2>
<p>
I made this page so I can reach as many people as possible. 
<p>
I think the only thing worthwhile in this life is adding value to each other's life
</p>
<p>
That's how you make relationships, that's how you find purpose, 
</p><p>
and that's also how you make money.
</p>
<h2>
EMAIL    
</h2>
<p>
I mostly use email to reply to specific asks/feedbacks and not for conversations.    
</p>
<p>
So hit me up if you think I can help you in any way possible!

<h2>
TWITTER    
</h2>
<p>Yeah I know the name's now X but I still like to call it twitter.</p>
<p>
Twitter is a place where I post some of deepest thoughts without any edits.    
</p>
<p>
I love the idea of a digital square that is still based on text, therefore chose    
</p>
<p>
twitter as my second favourite place after my own website.
