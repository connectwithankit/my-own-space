<h2>Life Lessons</h2>
<p>
As I grow, I am learning many life lessons. The idea behind this page is to compile a list of all the important lessons I have learned, realized, 
and imbibed in my life to some extent.
</p>
<p>
This would also serve as checklist for taking new actions based on the past learnings I've had for my
own self. 
</p>
<p>
I hope this also helps the reader in their journey.

<h3>The List</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Behind every action or thought, focus more on the seed of the action than the action itself. Actions stemmed from laziness
        breeds dissatisfaction.
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Consumption of anything leads to gluttony if not followed by creation. Creation is the final step of all consumption.<br>
        If you read a book (consume), write a review (create). <br>
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Time is an illusion that keeps us away from present. The best way to realise this is by immersing yourself in the process. 
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Society rewards you for your internal growth. 
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Self-image is the first step to look good. Poor self image harms more than any dressing sense. 
    </li><br>
    <li>
        It takes all kind of people to run this world. 
    </li><br> 
    <li>
        If there is only only one part of human body that one should focus on - let it be gut. Good gut is good life. 
    </li><br> 
    <li>
       Control brings fulfilment, surrender brings relief. Therefore it is imperative to control the inputs
       and surrender the outputs. 
    </li><br> 
    <li>
        Wonder is the fuel of life, not curiosity. 
     </li><br> 
     <li>
        Acing a difficult task in the morning solves 90% of all problems of the day. That is why it is recommended to 
        do a difficult workout the first thing in the morning.
     </li><br>
     <li>
        The way to mental transformation is through physical labour. Exhaust the body to tame the mind. 
     </li><br>
     <li>
        Your next day began today. Plan your next day today or you don't want the next day to go well.
     </li><br>
