<h2>WHAT I'M DOING NOW?</h2>
<p>
Every now and then, my friends ask me - "what's up" which is short for what's going on with me these days?
I generally reply with either a "nothing much" or elaborate plans that I intend to do but not doing right now. 
I created this page as a reply to the colloquial "what's up?".

<h2>
DAY JOB.  
</h2>
<p>
For the past four years I'm working as a software developer in Urban Company.   
I enjoy my work most of the times because of the financial independence it provides,
and other times because of the lovely team I have. Everyday through work I learn less
about coding but more about human relationships.

<h2>
YOGA    
</h2>
<p>
Since past few months or years I should say, I have found immense solace in Yoga that focuses on breath.    
Right now I'm stretching my yoga exercises a bit more and learning more about my breath and how it affects    
my body. I mainly practice <a href="https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/yoga/poses/padma-sadhana" target="_blank">Padma Sadhna</a> followed by three stage pranayama, bhastrika pranayama, and Sudarshan Kriya by Indian     
Yogi Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.

<h2>
CURRENTLY READING   
</h2>
<p>
I generally have a book that I read before bedtime. I've realised that the only time I've felt uninspired in life 
is when I stopped reading.
Currently I'm reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People" target="_blank">The Seven Habit of Highly Effective People</a> and 
I've been loving it so far. I'll write more about it once I finish it.
