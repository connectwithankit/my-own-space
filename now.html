<h2>WHAT I'M DOING NOW?</h2>
<p>
Updated June 10th, 2024, from my home in Gurugram.
</p>
<h2>
DAY JOB.  
</h2>
<p>
For the past three years I'm working as a software developer in Urban Company.    
</p>
<p>
I enjoy my work most of the times because of the financial independence it provides,    
</p>
<p>
and other times because of the lovely team I have. Everyday through work I learn less
</p>
<p>
about coding but more about human relationships.  
</p>
<h2>
YOGA    
</h2>
<p>
Since past few months or years I should say, I have found immense solace in Yoga that focuses on breath.     
</p>
<p>
Right now I'm stretching my yoga exercises a bit more and learning more about my breath and how it affects    
my body. I mainly practice the three stage pranayama, bhastrika pranayama, and Sudarshan Kriya by Indian     
Yogi Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.    
</p>
<h2>
CURRENTLY READING   
</h2>
<p>
I generally have a book that I read before bedtime and right now it is<strong> Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins.</strong> 
</p>
<h2>
DIGITAL DETOX    
</h2>
<p>
I've permanently left the smartphone and have switched to a feature phone to save my time and constant dopamine addiction.      
</p>
<p>
I access all the apps like twitter, whatsapp on my macbook. And for other usecases like booking an uber, accessing google maps etc.
</p>
<p>
I keep a spare smartphone that I turn on only when I go out and need the phone for these specific usecases.
