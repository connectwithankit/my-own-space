<h2>WHY THIS WEBSITE</h2>
<p>
<p>
I found a pressing need to make my own site and post my own content. I dabbled with a twitter account and wordpress blog but was so tired
of all the unnecessary features I didn't need to put my word out. That is when I came across <a href="https://sive.rs" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a>
and instantly fell in love with the simple design using HTML and CSS and realised how I should done all along. I emailed Derek with a specific ask and in reply   
he emailed me a template for this website.

I plan to use this as my personal workspace. No fancy substacks, no over the top designs, just me and my simple html and css.
