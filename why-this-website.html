<h2>WHY THIS WEBSITE</h2>
<p>
<p>
I found a pressing need to make my own site and post my own content.
</p>
<p>
I dabbled with a twitter account and wordpress blog but was so tired    
</p>
<p>
of all the unnecessary features I didn't need to put my word out.  
</p>
<p>
That is when I came across <a href="https://sive.rs" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a>
</p>
<p>
and instantly fell in love with the simple design using HTML and CSS and realised how    
</p>
<p>
it should have been done all along. I emailed Derek with a specific ask and in reply   
</p>
<p>
got the template for this website.    
</p>
<p>
Afterall, all we have done is by standing on the shoulder of giants   
</p>
<p>
I plan to use this as my personal workspace. No fancy substacks
</p><p>
no over the top designs, just me and my simple html and css.
